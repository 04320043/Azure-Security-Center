# Sample for remediating "Require Linux VM to use SSH key authentication"
These samples provide various ways to resolve the "*Require Linux VM to use SSH key authentication*" recommendation in Azure Security Center. There is one sample:
* **Azure Policy definitions**
    * Deny policy - This will prevent the creation of Linux VMs which use password instead of SSH key authentication for SSH.
